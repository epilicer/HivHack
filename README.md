The HIV epidemic has claimed numerous lives since its discovery in the 80â€™s. Over the years, the efforts and coordinated work of national programs, the civil society and development partners have allowed to achieve tremendous progress.

Even though there is still no cure for HIV, effective treatments have been developed and they can offer to patients long and healthy lives. However, treatments must be rigorously followed throughout life to successfully contain the virus. Failing to adhere to the treatment can lead to a mutation of the HIV into a form resistant to the available treatments. This is how HIV Drug Resistance can emerge.

Following the massive increase of people on treatment (from less than 800 000 in 2000 to more than 18 millions in 2016), a non-negligible rise in the prevalence of resistant HIV strains has emerged and threatens the global commitment to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.

If no action is taken now, and this problem left unaddressed, HIV Drug Resistance could lead to a new crisis in the HIV epidemic.
